Nearly 500 encounters are included in the game, and each one was carefully planned with unique movesets and cohesive teams to give each trainer a sense of individuality within the larger universe. Here, you won't be stomping your way through battles; instead, you'll be treated like any other trainer in the world, which will make your journey seem more like an adventure than a drag.
